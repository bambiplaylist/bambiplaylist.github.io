# bambiplaylist.github.io
A site to create your own bambi playlists and share them with friends!

bambi playlist has been an awesome and fairly successful project of mine but it is time to move on :). I don't have the time or the commitment to keep it maintained anymore but thank you for all your support and kind words! In 15 seconds you will be redirected automatically to the bambicloud.com website maintained by bambiislv. She has done an amazing job (she's waaay better at frontend than me hehe) at taking a cool idea and turning it into something awesome.

On a side note, I have also conducted a security audit on bambicloud's infrastructure and code (all of the problems were remediated quickly and without impact) and will continue to help keep it secure.
